I chose to use data from Walt Disney World in Florida obtained from a data set on the Map Zen Metro Extracts pages.
I chose this data since I have been to Walt Disney World many times and was interested to see what type of map data there
would be for this area since Walt Disney World is primarily a set of theme parks, but it can also be considered its own
city due to the many resorts, restaurants, and other amenities located throughout the Walt Disney World property.
